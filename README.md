# Password Generator 

## Description

- To create a random password generator that has prompts for user impute to select the incultion of lower, upper, and or special character and numbers. 
- To use functions and arrays to make parameters that allow the user to select the length of elements and an alert message when the parameters are not met. This includes the use of what we went over last week in the form of reassigning variables, arrays, and combining them with .concat
- Using the for loop example from the rock paper scissorâ€™s exercise and having it repeat tell the character length that the user imputed is reached.
- Using the Boolean value to have Js check if the parameters are met, if so the gereratePassword function runs, if not the error message shows to the user.
